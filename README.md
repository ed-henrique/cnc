# Compressed Network Communication

Application to demonstrate what was learned during Operational Systems classes with [Herbert Rocha](https://github.com/hbgit).

</br>

This application connects client and server using a socket, and a terminal to the server using a pipe. The client can pass commands to execute on the server's terminal, and then the output will be received by the client. It is similar to a chat app.

## Goals

‚úÖ means done.

üöß means doing.

‚ùå means won't do.

- ‚úÖ Support --log
- ‚úÖ Support --host
- ‚úÖ Log buffer before and after compression
- ‚úÖ Support --port for both server and client
- ‚úÖ Support more than one client during runtime
- ‚úÖ Pass input from client to server through socket
- ‚úÖ Use fork, pipe and execl to pass commands from server
- ‚úÖ Stop client and disconnect from server if an EOF (^D) is found
- ‚úÖ Use zlib to compress input from client and output from server (--compress)
- ‚ùå Process kills (^C) sent by the client on the server's side
- ‚ùå Use multi buffer system for better memory allocation

## Problems Encountered

### Problems:

1. **Passing SIGINT signal from client to server to kill terminal process in pipe;**

Possible Solutions:

1. We don't know how to pass the signal, although killing the process is fairly easy;

### Solved Problems:

1. **First command from client always comes with some junk**
    - Solution = We don't know exactly what changed, but it suddenly works. Even though fflush(stdin) is there, it always was there in the first place, so its weird that now it simply works.

2. **Can only read either first or last line from pipe output**
    - The solution was to change a line to line approach using fgets() to a read the file as a whole approach using fread().

3. **Using popen() instead of forking**
    - Implemented a solution using fork(), pipe() and execl(). To get output from execl, dup2() was used;

## Limitations

- Can't use interactive terminal commands (anything using sudo, htop, etc.).
- There is a limit to the number of clients that the server can support at once.
